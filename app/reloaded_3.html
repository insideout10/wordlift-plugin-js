HSBC’s Swiss bank concealed large sums of money for people facing allegations of serious wrongdoing, including drug-running, corruption and money laundering, leaked files reveal. Despite being legally obliged since 1998 to make special checks on high-risk customers, the bank provided accounts for clients implicated in six notorious scandals in Africa, including Kenya’s biggest corruption case, blood diamond trading and several corrupt military sales. HSBC also held assets for bankers accused of looting funds from former Soviet states, while alleged crimes by other account holders include bribery at Malta’s state oil company, cocaine smuggling from the Dominican Republic and the doping of professional cyclists in Spain. The Swiss bank also held accounts for “politically exposed people” – defined as senior political figures or their relatives at heightened risk of involvement in corruption, money laundering, or avoiding international sanctions – with little evidence of any extra scrutiny of their activities. The bank’s involvement varies from case to case, the files show. Sometimes, the secret accounts appear to have been directly used for allegedly corrupt transactions. In others, HSBC continued to provide banking services to individuals facing public allegations of wrongdoing. Other examples merely highlight how the secrecy of the Swiss banking system attracted people engaged in wrongdoing. Presented with this evidence by the Guardian, HSBC now admits that after it purchased the Geneva bank in 1999 “too many … high-risk accounts were maintained” and the “compliance culture and standard of due diligence” were low. The bank refused to discuss the details of individual clients, but said it had taken action to address the problems. It had closed the accounts of people who could not demonstrate compliance with tax obligations, stopped offering accounts in jurisdictions where proper due diligence was impossible and tightened up its “know your customer” and anti-money laundering procedures to “ensure a more complete consideration of a new client’s source of wealth”. This is not the first time HSBC has been criticised for failing to check its clients properly. In the US, a 2012 US Senate committee report was highly critical of HSBC’s poor money laundering controls, accusing managers of disregarding links to terrorist financing. They singled out the group’s dealings with wealthy Saudis. One of the most striking cases detailed in the leaked Swiss files involves Kenyan businessmen Deepak Kamani and Anura Perera, whose accounts were kept open by HSBC despite them being named in a highly publicised anti-corruption report in 2006.Investigator John Githongo, who later fled Kenya after ministers failed to support him, alleged the two men were the beneficiaries of contracts signed off by Kenyan politicians. The HSBC files detail payments to their offshore entities, called First Mercantile Securities Corporation, Midland Finance e Securities Ltd, and Infotalent Ltd. Notes on Perera’s HSBC records discuss a quarterly payment of “1mio” from the Kenyan government into his account, apparently delayed because of a shortage of state funds. Separately, Kamani’s notes show the bank kept his account open despite the allegations: “We spent some time discussing the ‘compliance’ issue facing this account. The clients again reiterated that there was no substance to the press reports that have been appearing in the press over the past nine months. They mentioned that only UBS and HSBC had raised the compliance issue in any meaningful way. “UBS have now closed the accounts for the client and the clients seemed pretty upset with this development. We explained to the clients that while we had discussed with compliance the issue, we continue to operate the account as has been normal over the past three years.” Swiss and Kenyan investigators are still probing the deals. A spokesman for Perera denied any wrongdoing. Requests for comment to Kamani were not returned. In another African corruption case, HSBC handled £20m in accounts controlled by Jeffrey Tesler, a small-scale London lawyer. Tesler, who was eventually jailed in the US, was fronting for the then president of Nigeria, General Sani Abacha, and other local politicians in a corrupt gas plant deal. Tesler’s HSBC account for Tristar Investments Ltd had an obscure address in the Seychelles. He was publicly named as a bribery suspect in 2004. But in 2007, HSBC was still operating Tristar and Tesler family accounts.
